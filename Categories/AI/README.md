# Machine Learning

## types of ML

1. Classification
2. Regression
3. Clustering
4. Dimensionality reduction

## Traditional ML Models

Build a tree structure to classify instances or fit a line or curve to make predictions

features chosen by domain experts

structured data such as numbers and probabilities

### Regression models
   1. Linear
   2. Lasso
   3. Ridge
   4. SVR

### Classfication models
   1. Naive Bayes
   2. SVMs
   3. Decision trees
   4. Random forests

### Dimensionality Reduction(models)
   1. Manifold learning
   2. factor analysis

### Clustering models
   1. K-means
   2. DBSCAN
   3. Spectral clustering

## Representation ML Models

Learn significant features from the underlying data

### Deep learning models

such as neural networks

each layer with neurons learn from data a bit

Pixels -> Edges -> Corners -> Object parts

features implicitly chosen by model itself

unstructured data such as images and movies

#### supervised and unsupervised
##### supervised
    got feature vector(x variables) and labels(y variables)
    seek the function f that links the features and labels
###### types of labels
    1. Categorical(classification)
    2. Continuous(regression)
##### unsupervised
    does not have y variables and a labeled corpus
    does have info to correct itself or tweak model parameters to become better
    model the underlying structure to learn more about data
    algorithms self-discover the patterns and structure in the data

    clustering(k-means)/dimensionality reduction(PCA)
