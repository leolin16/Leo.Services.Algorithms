# Graph Algorithms

## graph analytics

1. Query(e.g. Cypher/Phthon): real-time, local decisioning, pattern matching
2. Graph Algorithms Libraries: global analysis and iterations

## use cases

1. Identify the least costly or fastest way to route information or resources (google map)
2. reveal communities based on behavior for personalized recommendation ()
3. locate direct and indirect influence in a complex system (twitter)

## types of graph algorithms

1. Pathfinding & Search (find optimal paths or evaluates route availability and quality)
2. Centrality/Importance (determines the importance of distinct nodes in the network)
3. Community Detection (Detects group clustering or partition options)

## setup env

1. Apache Spark (spark sql, spark streaming, MLlib, GraphX Graph Frames -> Spark Graph)
2. Neo4j (data integration from: rdbms, nosql, data warehouse, data lake) (Graph Transactions for dev & admin) (analytics tooling for data analysts & data scientists) (drivers & apis for application) (discovery & visualization for business users)
